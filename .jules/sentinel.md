## 2025-12-17 - Error Boundary Information Disclosure
**Vulnerability:** The application was exposing full stack traces in the UI when an error occurred, even in production environments.
**Learning:** Developers often leave debug information in error boundaries for convenience, but this leaks internal path structures and dependency versions to potential attackers.
**Prevention:** Use `import.meta.env.DEV` (or equivalent environment checks) to conditionally render stack traces only in development environments, showing generic messages in production.
